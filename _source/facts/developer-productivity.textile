By cutting Internet Explorer out of the equation, we get the following:

*(good) One size fits all development patterns
*(good) Better User Experience
*(good) Faster Turnaround
*(good) Standards Compliant
*(good) Happier Customers

This is because Internet Explorer requires us to rebuild our software according to Non-Standard Compliant practices.

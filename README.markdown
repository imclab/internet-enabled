# Internet Enabled

This is a site that will be a place to direct your clients to to help them understand why they should not use Internet Explorer.

Get them [Internet Enabled](http://internetenabled.org/).

For us, it just takes too long and isn't worth the sacrifice to make Internet Explorer render correctly.  But for the rest of the world, they have no idea.  They use what's there.  All they need is simple, clear, relevant information and they'd love to make the switch.

If you have any content or ideas, please send them over and I will get back to you right away.

TODO:

- The contact form doesn't work, don't think there should be one...
- Better/refactored information :)
- One-click browser installer (figures out OS and such).  So the user downloads it directly from Internet Enabled.
